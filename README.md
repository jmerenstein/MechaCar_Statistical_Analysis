# An Analysis of MechaCar

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- The variable or coefficients that provide non random amounts of variance to the mpg in the data set are vehicle length and ground clearance.
- The slope of the linear model here is not zero because the r squared value is .71. This means that roughly 71% of predictions will be accurate using this linear regression model.
- Yes the linear model does a pretty good job of projecting mpg of MechaCar prototypes because the r squared value is .71. Any r sqaured value that is above .70 for a model is considered to be an indicator of a strong correlation. Since this regression model is above .70, it has a strong correlation and therefore can be seen as doing a good job of projecting mpg of MechaCar prototypes. 

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
To view the results and the analysis click [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/joshua.merenstein#!/vizhome/CitiBikeStory_16148869711870/CitiBikeStory?publish=yes) and it will take you to the Teableau Public story I created for this proposal. There are seven different graphs and visualtions that you can click through. Above each visualtization is an explanation of what the results of each speciific graph means. 

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
- The main results from this analyisis is that a large majority of bikesharing riders in New York City are males. We also learned that most people that rent bikes, especially males, rent them in the hours between 6-9AM and 5-7PM suggesting that people rent them to commute to and from work. With this knowledge we can compare that data to how many people we think in Des Moines would be as likely to rent during these peak periods as in New York City.
- Two additional visualtizations that I would suggest for further analyis would be to see the age of people who rent bikes and how long people typically stay as subsribers to the bikesharing companies. I think both of these visualtizations could give us much further inisght into if the bikesharing company would be viable in Des Moines.
